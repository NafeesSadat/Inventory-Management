# Warehouse Management System - Flask Application

This repository contains a Flask-based Warehouse Management System that handles various operations such as inventory management, inbound and outbound shipments, and user authentication with role-based access control. The application uses PostgreSQL as the database backend, with SQLAlchemy for ORM (Object-Relational Mapping).

## Prerequisites

Before running the application, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- **Python 3.7+**
- **PostgreSQL 12+** or any version compatible with SQLAlchemy
- **pip** (Python package manager)
- **Flask** and other required Python packages

## Installation

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NafeesSadat/Inventory-Management.git
cd Inventory-Management
```

### 2. Set up a virtual environment (recommended)

Activate a virtual environment by running the following commands:

#### On Windows:

```bash
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate
```

#### On macOS/Linux:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 3. Install dependencies

Once the virtual environment is activated, install the required Python packages using `pip`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Set up PostgreSQL Database

#### Database Configuration:

You need to have PostgreSQL running on your local machine or use a remote PostgreSQL server. Create a new database for the application: `warehouse_db`.

1. **Create the database**:
   Log into PostgreSQL and run the following command to create the database:

   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE warehouse_db;
   ```

2. **Update the Database URL in the config file**:
   Open the `config.py` file in your project and update the database URI to match your PostgreSQL credentials:

   ```python
   SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI = 'postgresql://<username>:<password>@localhost/warehouse_db'
   SQLALCHEMY_TRACK_MODIFICATIONS = False
   ```

   Replace `<username>` and `<password>` with your actual PostgreSQL username and password.

#### Table Creation:

When running the application for the first time, the tables should be automatically created. If thereâ€™s an error or the tables are not created, you can manually create them by running the following SQL script in your PostgreSQL database:

```sql
CREATE TABLE role (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    description VARCHAR(200)
);

CREATE TABLE "user" (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    username VARCHAR(150) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    password VARCHAR(150) NOT NULL,
    role_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
    FOREIGN KEY (role_id) REFERENCES role(id)
);

CREATE TABLE inventory (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    category VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    sku VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    location VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    quantity INTEGER NOT NULL,
    supplier VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE inbound (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    reference VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    date_received DATE NOT NULL,
    product_sku VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    quantity INTEGER NOT NULL,
    location VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    remarks VARCHAR(200),
    FOREIGN KEY (product_sku) REFERENCES inventory(sku)
);

CREATE TABLE outbound (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    reference VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    date_shipped DATE NOT NULL,
    product_sku VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    quantity INTEGER NOT NULL,
    destination VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    remarks VARCHAR(200),
    FOREIGN KEY (product_sku) REFERENCES inventory(sku)
);
```

### 5. Run the Flask Application

To start the Flask application, simply run:

```bash
python run.py
```

The application will be hosted locally, and you can access it in your web browser at:

```
http://127.0.0.1:5000/
```

## Application Features

1. **Inventory Management**:
   - Add, update, and search inventory items.
   - Inventory records include product category, SKU, name, location, quantity, and supplier.

2. **Inbound Shipments**:
   - Add new inbound shipments.
   - Track received products, including SKU, quantity, location, and remarks.
   - Automatically update the inventory when items are received.

3. **Outbound Shipments**:
   - Add new outbound shipments.
   - Track shipped products, including SKU, quantity, destination, and remarks.
   - Automatically update the inventory when items are shipped.

4. **User Authentication and Role-based Access**:
   - Users can register and log in with their credentials.
   - Roles such as `manager` and `operator` control access to different parts of the application.
   - The manager role has access to inventory management, while the operator role has access to inbound and outbound shipment management.

## Running the Application

1. **User Login**:
   - Navigate to `/login` and enter the username and password. The application uses hashed passwords for security.

2. **Inventory Actions**:
   - You can view and search inventory items under the `/inventory` route.
   - Managers can add or update inventory items.

3. **Inbound and Outbound Shipments**:
   - Operators can manage inbound and outbound shipments via the `/inbound` and `/outbound` routes.
   - Both routes allow users to add records and automatically update inventory levels.

## Troubleshooting

- **Error Creating Tables**: If the tables are not created automatically, you can create them manually using the provided SQL script.
- **Database Connection Issues**: Ensure that your PostgreSQL server is running and the credentials in the `config.py` file are correct.
- **Missing Dependencies**: If you encounter missing dependencies, make sure you have installed all required Python packages by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
